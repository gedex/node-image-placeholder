        h2 Description
        p
            | Image Placeholder is an open-source Node.js app to serve images for your image placeholder.
            | You can grab the source here. This demo instance shows you that it's possible to run
            | this app in heroku so that you can deploy your own instance.

        h2 Examples
        p
            | An image with <code>300x300</code> (width, height) can be requested with: <code>#{url}300</code>
            | or <code>#{url}300x300</code>.
            | Here's the rendered image:
        p.center
            img(src="#{url}300")
        p
            | Change foreground and background colors with
            | <code>#{url}400x120/fff/ff0000</code>
        p.center
            img(src="#{url}400x120/fff/ff0000")

        h2 Limitations
        p
            | The rendered image is generated by node_canvas. At the moment, it only suport
            | PNG. I keep this placeholder simple without text-in-image overriden.
